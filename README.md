This is the part of the code form my Bachelor's Thesis, which I referece in my written thesis.

This code is used in the offical [visMOP](https://github.com/UniTuebingen-BDVA/visMOP) code. It was inserted there by my supervisor.

The bezier-curve-algorithm.ts can be found [here](https://github.com/UniTuebingen-BDVA/visMOP/blob/main/vismop-vue/src/core/custom-nodes/bezier-curve-program.ts) and edge-path-bundling_typescript.ts can be found [here](https://github.com/UniTuebingen-BDVA/visMOP/blob/d8671503c1cdf3c8c6896d7b0c019c7463e31174/vismop-vue/src/core/reactomeGraphs/reactomeOverviewNetwork/overviewNetwork.ts#L1266).
